Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.
Think of what you're saying, you can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright. Think of what I'm saying, we can work it out and get it straight or say good night.
May you find the power in understanding the journey of others to help create your own.
If you can hear this, you're alone. The only thing left of me is the sound of my voice. I don't know if any of us made it. So let me tell you who we were. And how we fought back.
A long, long time ago. I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance, and maybe they'd be happy for a while.
I do this thing where I think I'm really sick, but I won't go to the doctor to find out about it, because they make you stay real still in a real small place, as they chart up your insides and put them on display. They'd see all of it. All of me. All the good that won't come out of me.
I think if you don't really like a girl, you shouldn't horse around with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water all over it. It's really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes.
And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song.
You plonker, you think I don't know a toilet when I see one? You were going to flush me down the loo.
In a business like this the people with the power are the ones that have the understanding of what's going on, not necessarily the ones on top.
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you, you broke my heart and there's nothing you can do. And now you know, now you know, true friends stab you in the front.
And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul, there walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last.
As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and movement stopped for much, much more than a moment.
A few minutes ago, I almost made the biggest mistake of my professional life and it was because I was doing something that just wasn't me.
I never should have told you, I never should have let you see inside, don't want it troubling in your mind. Won't you let it be?
It is unwise to make something permanent when the whole world is shifting. There may be a time when this symbol means something treacherous and terrible, rather than something noble and literate.
Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned.
